# Agile Methodologies Case Study

This project is a comprehensive case study applying Agile Methodologies to a real-world business case - Fierce Shoe, a sustainable baby footwear brand founded to create eco-friendly, high-quality, and development-friendly shoes for children.
- The work explores the company’s challenges, including its virtual queue sales system, limited physical retail presence, and returns process. Using tools such as empathy maps, RICE prioritisation, business model canvas, and lean innovation proposals, the project aims to identify customer needs, prioritise improvements, and design strategic solutions. 
- The objectives include enhancing the customer experience, increasing operational efficiency, and aligning the company’s processes with agile principles for adaptability and continuous improvement. Ultimately, the project provides a practical framework for leveraging agile thinking to drive innovation and sustainable growth in a niche consumer market.

## Fierce Shoe: Background

Lydia Gould is an industrial designer with over 10 years of experience designing footwear for large multinational corporations.

After becoming a mother in 2015, Lydia wanted to find the perfect shoe for her baby to wear when starting to walk—something that would let her baby's feet and walking develop naturally, without causing any issues or hindrances to her child's growth.

However, after a lot of searching, she couldn't find any shoes that met her needs. So, together with her partner, she decided to start Fierce Shoe and create shoes based on her own philosophy: designed specifically for babies, environmentally friendly, gender-neutral, practical, and high-quality.

What began as a side project alongside her professional career has now become her main focus. In the early days, Fierce Shoe could sell around 1,000 pairs of shoes per season—a modest number but enough for Lydia and her husband to decide to quit their jobs and focus entirely on their project. The product’s quality and their close relationship with customers spread by word of mouth so effectively that, in the following season, they sold in 9 days what they had projected to sell over the entire year.

Despite the rapid growth of Fierce Shoe, their strategy has always been to take things step by step, keeping close contact with both their customers and their product. Mainly, they sell through their website and other online platforms. They can't sell in many physical stores because the profit margins aren't sufficient. Additionally, due to the high demand each season, their shoes sell out very quickly, and they offer a pre-sale that includes a virtual queue for purchases. Occasionally, they’ve also used crowdfunding to raise funds and develop new models for slightly older children.

Fierce Shoe features Spanish design and is manufactured in Portugal. They use materials that are safe for children and the environment (the leather is not tanned with heavy metals or chrome and includes vegan materials), and they have a small team along with collaborators specializing in both physical and cognitive child development.
