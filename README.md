# Agile Methodologies Case Study

This project is a comprehensive case study applying Agile Methodologies to a real-world business case - Fierce Shoe, a sustainable baby footwear brand founded to create eco-friendly, high-quality, and development-friendly shoes for children. The work explores the company’s challenges, including its virtual queue sales system, limited physical retail presence, and returns process. Using tools such as empathy maps, RICE prioritisation, business model canvas, and lean innovation proposals, the project aims to identify customer needs, prioritise improvements, and design strategic solutions. The objectives include enhancing the customer experience, increasing operational efficiency, and aligning the company’s processes with agile principles for adaptability and continuous improvement. Ultimately, the project provides a practical framework for leveraging agile thinking to drive innovation and sustainable growth in a niche consumer market.
